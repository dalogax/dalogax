## 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel!

I'm a **Staff Engineer at Inditex**, where I run a chapter of talented backend engineers and help architect practical solutions for our global ecommerce. 🌍

In the past years, I’ve been untangling a legacy monolith.  
Now that we are almost free from the monster 🐉, I'm focused on **performance**, **maintainability**, and developer **productivity**.

My main stack is **Java**, with occasional side-quests in **Python** and **JavaScript**. Lately, coding in English through **AI agents** is fun and fast—but also quite the challenge. 🤖 _Watch them closely._

I tend to have opinions on everything and I love debating, but I won’t push my views unless I can convince you with my arguments—or occasionally, your exhaustion. 😅

If you made it this far, thanks! I owe you a coffee. ☕
